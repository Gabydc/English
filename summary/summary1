\author{Gabriela Diaz}

\section{}
This essay explores the evolution of gender inequality, giving special attention to women discrimination.
Women had suffered a pervasive gender discrimination since ancient times. From the ancient Greeks, 
that deprive women from legal status, 
to the Chinese civilization that gave them a lower status than a man. 
There has been a substantial effort to achieve equality.Â 
In 1970's, there was a major protest in the USA seeking for women's rights. Women in Europe gain their 
right to vote in the 19th century.  
After these and more efforts, women's rights have improved. Even if discrimination has also diminished 
remarkably for women, there is still some, but the efforts to avoid it are still there.
