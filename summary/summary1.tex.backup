\section*{Women's rights and gender discrimination, a summary of Yushan Zhang essay}
\hfill by Gabriela Berenice Diaz Cortes (EAP3, Wed).\\\\
\large This essay explores the evolution of gender inequality, giving special attention to women discrimination.\\
Women had suffered a pervasive gender discrimination since ancient times. From the ancient Greeks 
that deprive women from legal status, 
to the Chinese civilization that gave them a lower status than a man. 
In recent times, there has been a substantial effort to achieve equality.
In 1970's, there was a major protest in the USA seeking for women's rights. Women in Europe gain their 
right to vote in the 19th century.  
After these and more efforts, women's rights have improved. Even if discrimination has also diminished 
remarkably for women, there is still some, but there are efforts to eradicate it.
